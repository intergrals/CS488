Compilation:

The program can be compiled from the A1 directory (the one this file is in) and running the following commands:
- premake4 gmake
- make
afterwards, the compiled program can be run from the same directory using the command:
- ./A1

The program was compiled on computer gl29 of MC3007.


Manual:

Here are details for implementations made for ambiguous specifications:
- Button labels have additional text showing the hotkey that the function is mapped to.
- Rotation gravity persists until the mouse is clicked outside of the debug window. The gravity also stops when a supported key on the keyboard (one which maps to a function) is pressed.
- Scaling and rotation can be used together.
- Using the debug window will not stop a rotating maze, but the changes will still occur.
- Walls do not have a maximum height, but have a minimum height of 0.
- The user can zoom in to a maximum of 3x and can zoom out to a minimum of 0.2x.
- The player will be placed on the top left square when the program is first opened and when reset.
- The start of the maze is at the bottom.

In addition to the specifications, the following has been added:
- The terminal will print "chomp" every time the player eats a piece of the maze.
- The 'D' key has been remapped to 'ENTER' due to a new addition.
- Certain keys can be held down for continuous input. Specifically, this will only work for player movement and changing wall height.
- Using the WASD keys, the camera can be moved around. The keys can also be held down for continuous input. There is a limit for how far the camera can be moved, and it's well within reasonable standards.
- A 'follow' feature has been added, which, when enabled, allows the camera to move automatically to center around follow the player. It can be turned on or off from the debug window or by pressing 'F'. Note that the camera can still be moved away from the player using the WASD keys.

I had several more ambitious ideas which unfortunately did not make it into the final version:
- Making the player the center of rotation if follow is enabled. This did not prove to be fully functional. It can be toggled via 'B' only works when follow is enabled.
- Textures. I tried various methods using both provided and unprovided sources. Ultimately textures could not be implemented properly.
