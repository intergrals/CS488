Compilation:

The program can be compiled from the A5 directory (the one this file is in) and running the following commands:
- premake4 gmake
- make (config=release)
afterwards, the compiled program can be run from the same directory using the command:
- ./A5 ({scene}.lua)

My scene can be rendered by calling:
- ./A5 sample.lua

The program was compiled on computer gl16 of MC3007.


Time Log:

November:
20 - Made directory for A5. Moved A4 files over. Updated the gitignore. Added basic reflection - although it looks a little off.
22 - Tidied up code from A4. Worked on reflection a little more. Looks better. Moved some code to methods in order to make use of multithreading.
26 - Added multithreading. Took a while to implement multithreading for supersampling (bonus A4 objective). Also had trouble finding an optimal way to divide workload between threads.
26 - Tidied up ray casting code even more. Added adaptive anti-aliasing (1x, 2x, 4x, 8x, 16x). Added multithreading for adaptive anti-aliasing.
