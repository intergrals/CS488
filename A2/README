Compilation:

The program can be compiled from the A2 directory (the one this file is in) and running the following commands:
- premake4 gmake
- make
afterwards, the compiled program can be run from the same directory using the command:
- ./A2

The program was compiled on computer gl17 of MC3007.


Manual:

Here are details for implementations made for ambiguous specifications:
- Most of the values will change in a reasonable pace. Translations happen at the pace of mouse movement, moving the mouse one screen-length provides one rotation, etc...
- The two gnomons each have a unique colour for each directional axis, and both gnomons use different colours so that they are easier to distinct when they are close together.
- The default nearplane is 1 and the default farplane is 5. The default field of view is 50 degrees. The default viewframe size covers 90% of the screen.
- The model has been translated slightly to the left and down so that the model gnomon does not overlap with the world gnomon.
- The model has been translated back several units and scaled down 20% so that it appears at a reasonable size.
- No other initial transformations have been applied.
- In the case where multiple mouse buttons are held down on rotation, the rotations will be applied in the following order: x, y, z.
